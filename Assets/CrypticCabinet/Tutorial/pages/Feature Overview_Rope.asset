    an initial prototype based on a chain of physics colliders, it was decided to
    opt for a Verlet rope implementation instead, heavily based on <a href=\"https://github.com/GaryMcWhorter/Verlet-Chain-Unity\">this
    open source example</a>. The issue with the first prototype was that the result
    looked like the rope was made up of sticks and was quite difficult to tune, while
    the second approach gave much more realistic results. \nIt took a few iterations
    to fine tune the correct amount of bones for the skeleton of the final asset,
    to make sure it looked fluid without affecting performance. \nAnother aspect
    to improve its look and feel was to avoid making it feel elastic: that\u2019s
    why, when pulling, it was preferred to make it come out of the ceiling instead
    of stretching it.\nIn terms of interaction, the rope can be grabbed from any
    point along its length, using one or two hands. This is implemented by placing
    a Grabbable on the rope following the user's hand, once the user grabs the Grabbable
    it locks to the nearest node in the rope and that node then follows the user's
    hand. This is duplicated with a second Grabbable for the other hand. These grabbed
    positions are synchronized with the other users over the network so remote users
    can see the active player grabbing the rope.\nAnother important element to make
    the rope feel more real was to ensure that it collided correctly with walls and
    other objects in the scene. Collisions are calculated using <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc.html\">Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc</a>
    and <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.ComputePenetration.html\">Physics.ComputePenetration</a>
    to push rope nodes away from each other and from scene objects. In terms of multiplayer,each
    client calculates their own rope updates, but they share some fixed locations
    when the rope is being held by a user.\n\n\n### Relevant Files\n- <a href=\"./Assets/CrypticCabinet/Scripts/Puzzles/SandPuzzle/Rope.cs\">Rope.cs</a>\n\n"
