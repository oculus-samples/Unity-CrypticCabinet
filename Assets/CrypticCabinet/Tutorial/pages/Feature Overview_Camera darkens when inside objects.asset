  m_overrideMarkdownText: '# Camera Darkens When Inside Objects


    The camera
    darkens if the user tries to put their head inside furniture like the Orrery.
    Initially, a Unity <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@14.0/manual/Volumes.html">Volume</a>
    was used to fade out visible geometry as the user approached. However, this didn''t
    affect <a href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/">passthrough</a>
    rendering due to privacy restrictions. To overcome this, an additional trigger
    volume using OnTriggerEnter and OnTriggerExit was added to enable and disable
    passthrough. This trigger volume is slightly smaller than the fade volume, ensuring
    a smooth passthrough switch-off during the 3D geometry fading effect.
