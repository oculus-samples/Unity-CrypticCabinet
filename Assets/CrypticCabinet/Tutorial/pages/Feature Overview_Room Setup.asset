  m_overrideMarkdownText: "# Room Setup\nThis section describes the system used to
    automatically populate a generic real world room with game objects.\nThe <a href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-scene-overview/\">Scene
    API</a> is used to understand the space the user is in. Using the returned scene
    primitives, a 3d grid of cells is generated to cover the entire room and track
    where scene objects are placed.\nThis is to allow the room setup system to detect
    safe locations where to place game objects and to minimize overlapping with real
    world objects. This requires the user to set up their scene accurately to ensure
    the best possible experience.\nFree space in the 3d grid is visualized as green
    cells, while non-valid locations are shown in red. For example, in the following
    image you can see that the wall has some available space (green), but we are
    excluding the window (in red).Same for the floor which has red areas underneath
    desks and shelving.\n\nNote: To visualize the 3d grid in build, toggle the debug
    view by pressing down and holding on the left joystick, then press A on the right
    controller.\n\n![alt text](../Documentation/Images/RoomSetup.png){style=\"width:40%;height:40%\"}\n\nThere
    are four categories of placement location; \u201Cfloor\u201D, \u201Cwall\u201D,
    \u201Cdesks\u201D and \u201Cagainst wall\u201D. \u201CAgainst wall\u201D objects
    are the ones that need to be on the floor but also against a wall: a good example
    of this is the cabinet.\nAs an object is placed it blocks out the cells that
    it covers to prevent other objects from being placed in the same location.\nObjects
    are placed in the following order:\n1. Objects on floor against a wall \n2. Objects
    on walls \n3. Objects on desks (if no desks available, fallback to floor)\n4.
    Objects on floor \n5. Objects on any horizontal location.\n\nWithin each category
    objects are placed in order of size: largest to smallest.\nIf an object fails
    to find a safe location, it is placed in a  random valid location. For example,
    wall objects will stay on walls and floor objects will stay on floor, even if
    they are overlapping with other objects or scene objects.\n\nAfter all objects
    have been automatically placed, there\u2019s a few seconds of \u201Ceasing\u201D:
    this allows for any objects that are overlapping to repel away from each other.The
    easing is done using the Unity physics engine function <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.ComputePenetration.html\">ComputePenetration</a>,
    this gives a direction and distance to move objects to cause them to no longer
    overlap. Rather than jumping the objects to these new locations, this system
    lerps towards the location allowing opportunities for multiple objects to move
    away from each other over time.\n\n\nOnce the placement is complete, the user
    then has an opportunity to preview the generated layout. Objects in this phase
    are visualized as colored boxes:\n - Blue boxes: items that need to be physically
    reached during the experience because the user will interact with them using
    hands/controllers.\n - Green boxes: items that need to be visible, but don\u2019t
    need to be reached.\n - Red boxes: items that are in a non valid location, are
    overlapping with each other or are overlapping with scene objects.\nIn this phase,
    the user has an opportunity to manually move these boxes around, if necessary,
    to make sure there\u2019s no red boxes and that all blue boxes can be physically
    reached.\n\n![alt text](../Documentation/Images/SpawningBoxes.png){style=\"width:50%;height:50%\"}\n\nAfter
    this, the user can confirm the layout and start the experience.  Object positions
    are then stored and used during gameplay to avoid re-doing these heavy calculations.\n\n\n###
