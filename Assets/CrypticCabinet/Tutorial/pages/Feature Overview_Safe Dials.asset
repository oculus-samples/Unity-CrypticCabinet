    There
    is no off the shelf solution that would allow for a single finger to be used
    to swipe up and down to scroll through the numbers on the safe in a natural way.
    The <a href="./Assets/CrypticCabinet/Scripts/Puzzles/Safe/SwipeDetector.cs">final
    implementation</a> simply puts a trigger collider on the index finger of the
    user''s hands and then detects if they start in the middle of the dial and swipe
    up or down. When a swipe has been detected the number carousel is animated up
    or down and once all dials read the correct values the safe door animates open.
