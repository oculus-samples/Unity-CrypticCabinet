    the UV bulb and the key require two interaction modes. First, a mode for free
    manipulation, allowing users to grab, move, and rotate objects. Second, a mode
    where the object is locked to a position and can only rotate around a single
    axis. Although both modes exist in the Meta Quest API as <a href=\"https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-grabbable/#one-grab-transformers\">OneGrabFreeTransformer
    and OneGrabRotateTransformer</a>, they can't be dynamically switched after the
    <a href=\"https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-grabbable/\">Grabbable</a>
    is initialized. The solution is a new script, <a href=\"./Assets/CrypticCabinet/Scripts/Interactions/OneGrabToggleRotateTransformer.cs\">OneGrabToggleRotateTransformer</a>,
    combining both functionalities with logic to toggle between them at runtime.\n\nFor
    the key, once snapped into the lock, it switches to rotation-only mode, tracking
    rotation until it's spun anti-clockwise enough to unlock the drawer. For the
    bulbs, they need to be snapped in place, screwed, and/or unscrewed. This requires
    toggling between free movement and locked rotation when snapped/unsnapped, then
    raising/lowering the bulb during the screwing/unscrewing motion.\n\n![alt text](../Documentation/Images/Key.gif){style=\"width:50%;height:50%\"}\n\n\n###
