    Leverage Mixed Reality Utility Kit on top of the Scene API to quickly index and
    query an up-to-date representation of the physical world that you can use to
    support mixed reality. Scene enables Cryptic Cabinet to support dynamic interactions
    between users, virtual objects, and their physical space. \n- <a href=\"https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/\">Passthrough</a>:
    See your physical space in full, rich color. Passthrough API provides a real-time
    and perceptually comfortable 3D visualization of the physical world in the Meta
    Quest headsets so users can see and navigate their surroundings.\n- <a href=\"https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-shared-spatial-anchors/\">Shared
    Spatial Anchors</a>: Create local multiplayer experiences for users in the same
    room. Shared Spatial Anchors enables a shared, world-locked frame of reference
    for many users playing Cryptic Cabinet together.   \n- <a href=\"https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-set-up-colocation-package/\">Colocation</a>:
    Enable users to jump into the action together in the same physical space. Using
    Shared Spatial Anchors, colocation supports sharing physical environment information
    between headsets to enable accurate virtual positioning so players have a consistent,
    shared perspective of their surroundings. \n- <a href=\"https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-interaction-sdk-overview/\">Interaction

    and techniques used to deliver this unique and engaging multiplayer experience.
    For more information, visit the <a href=\"./Documentation/FeatureOverview.md\">Feature
    Overview</a> page.\n\n    ![alt text](./Documentation/Images/UVbulb_screw.gif){style=\"width:30%\"}\n   
    ![alt text](./Documentation/Images/Safe.gif){style=\"width:30%\"}\n    ![alt
    text](./Documentation/Images/Key.gif){style=\"width:30%\"}\n\n\n- <a href=\"./Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#room-setup\">Room
    Setup</a>: Using returned scene primitives via Scene API, a 3D grid of cells
    is generated to cover the entire room and track where scene objects are placed
    so they don\u2019t overlap with real world objects. You can preview the scene
    after cells are generated. \n- <a href=\"./Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#networking\">Networking</a>:
    Using Photon Fusion, Cryptic Cabinet provides the game host with a room code
    that they can share with other users and enable them to join.\n- <a href=\"./Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#rope\">Rope</a>:
    Through Interaction SDK, users can grab the in-game rope at any point along its
    length using one or two hands, with grabbed positions being synchronized with
    other users. Realistic collisions are supported to push rope nodes away from
    each other and from scene objects. \n- <a href=\"./Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#lut\">LUT</a>:
    Using Passthrough Styling, the Passthrough camera feed is darkened when a user
    activates the game\u2019s UV light or Orrery projection to deliver the effect
    of being in a dark room. A central manager ensures the effect is replicated for
    all users.  \n- <a href=\"./Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#camera-darkens-when-inside-objects\">Camera
    darkens when inside objects</a>: When a user puts their head inside virtual objects,
    the camera darkens to replicate a more realistic perspective. Passthrough is
    disabled and enabled as users look in and out of virtual objects. \n- <a href=\"./Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#safe-dials\">Safe
    Dials</a>: By putting a trigger collider on the index finger of a user\u2019s
    hand, users can seamlessly swipe the game\u2019s safe dial up and down to crack
    the safe\u2019s code. \n- <a href=\"./Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#clock\">Clock</a>:
    Through the use of the OneGrabRotateTransformer feature, users can rotate a handle
    that subsequently rotates the game\u2019s clock hands to detect when the user
    has selected the correct time, opening the clock door. \n- <a href=\"./Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#key--uv-bulb\">Key
    & UV Bulb</a>: The game\u2019s UV bulb and key combine two interaction modes:
    The first mode enables users to freely manipulate these objects by grabbing,
    rotating, and moving them, and the second mode locks the objects in position
    so they can only be rotated around a single axis. \n\n\n\n# Project Structure\nThe
    project is organically structured to distinguish the main components of the MR
    experience's logic. A breakdown of the core features is defined on the <a href=\"./Assets/CrypticCabinet/Scenes/MainScene.Unity\">Main
    Scene</a> under the \"**CrypticCabinetLogic**\" GameObject.\n\nThe **CrypticCabinetLogic**
    contains the following core objects:\n\n- **ColocationManager**, which is responsible
    for colocating multiple players within the same room, and to keep a single player
    aligned to the real room throughout the gameplay. For more information, check
    the documentation inside the **ColocationManager** script.\n\n- **ConnectionManager**,
    which handles the Photon Fusion connection workflows for single and multiplayer
    sessions. The PhotonConnector logic showcases how a shared multiplayer session
    is handled via Photon Fusion, how the creation of shared rooms and lobbies work,
    and how the connection states can be handled accordingly.\n\n- **PassthroughManager**,
    which is responsible for the Color LUT effects applied to the passthrough of
    the supported Quest headsets. During the gameplay, this feature is showcased
    when interacting with the UV machine puzzle and the light beam hitting the glass
    globe in the Orrery puzzle. Additional functions are implemented inside the **PassthroughConfigurator**
    and **PassthroughChanger** as an example of customized effects using Meta's Color
    LUT APIs from the SDK.\n\n- **SceneManagement**, which holds the logic to use
    the Scene Understanding API from the SDK to configure the virtual objects placements
    around the real room of the player, allowing their tweaking when desired.\n\n-
    **GameManager**, which controls the game phases flow of the gameplay.\n\n- **Player**,
    which holds the logic for all the interactions a player can perform across the
    whole experience. This showcases how the Meta Interaction SDK can be used to
    simplify usability for XR scenarios.\n\n\n# Gameplay Phases\n\nThe <a href=\"./Assets/CrypticCabinet/Scripts/GameManagement/GameManager.cs\">**GameManager**</a>
    script controls the game phases of the gameplay. Each game phase is responsible
    for a specific task of the game:\n- **ObjectSpawningGamePhase** handles the scene
    setup via the scene understanding APIs to tweak the placements for the virtual
    objects around the room before starting the gameplay;\n- **WaitForGuestPhase**
    waits for Guest players that want to join a multiplayer game before the gameplay
    starts;\n- **Act1TimelinePhase** starts the intro animation of the gameplay;\n-
    **PuzzleLoadingGamePhase** spawns the interactive objects around the room after
    the intro animation has finished playing;\n- **Act3TimelinePhase** starts the
    outro animation once the gameplay completes and all puzzles are resolved.\n\n\n\n#
    UI System\n\nThe main UI for the application is defined through the <a href=\".\\Assets\\CrypticCabinet\\UI\\UIModalWindow.prefab\">**UIModalWindow**</a>
    prefab, which is controlled by the <a href=\".\\Assets\\CrypticCabinet\\Scripts\\UI\\UISystem.cs\">UISystem
    script</a>.\n\nThis script conveniently defines a singleton object that any class
    in the game can interact with to trigger UI messages and callbacks.\n\n\n\n#
